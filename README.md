# Message Encoding with Matrices

Welcome to the **Message Encoding with Matrices** project! This repository contains a collection of programs that demonstrate how to encode and decode messages using matrix manipulation techniques. It serves as a practical introduction to mathematical approaches for cryptography and data encoding.

## Description

This repository is designed to help you understand the process of encoding messages using matrices. It provides various Java implementations that illustrate different matrix-based encoding methods, such as:

- **Matrix Encryption:** Using matrices to transform plaintext messages into encoded ciphertext.
- **Matrix Multiplication:** Utilizing matrix multiplication for encoding and decoding messages.
- **Inverses and Modulo Operations:** Applying matrix inversion and modulo operations to ensure secure encoding/decoding.
- **Matrix Representation:** Representing messages as matrices and applying mathematical transformations for encoding.

Explore the provided examples to deepen your understanding of matrix-based encryption techniques and their applications in cryptography!

## Requirements

To run the programs, ensure you have the following installed:

- **JDK 8 or higher:** Make sure you have the Java Development Kit installed to compile and run the Java programs.
- **NetBeans or any Java IDE:** You can use any Integrated Development Environment that supports Java, but NetBeans is recommended for ease of use with this project.
